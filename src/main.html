    In order to run this demo from the file system, Chrome must be launched
    with a specific flag: --allow-file-access-from-files
    All instances of Chrome must be shutdown prior to launching with the above.
    e.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --allow-file-access-from-files

    Once the page is loaded open ChromeDevTools.

    Press the "Init" buttorn first. This will initialize the WebWorker and prepare it for servicing requests.

    Press the "Do It!" button next. Whenever this button is pressed, the main thread will make a request to the WebWorker and await for it to complete the asynchonous request.

    Logging can be observed in the ChromeDevTools Console window.
